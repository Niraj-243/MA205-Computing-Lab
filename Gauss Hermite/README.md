Gauss-Hermite branch:
# Gauss-Hermite

In the Gauss-Hermite branch, there are 7 .m files, the work of each of them are explained as comments.
run1.m takes parameters as function and m (from 0 upto m point formula is applied) and plots the value of integral I 
obtained versus n (parameter, varies from 0 to m).(In this case, the limits of integration is from -inf to +inf, which is naturally the limits for gauss hermite)
